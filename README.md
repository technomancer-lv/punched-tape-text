Program for converting text data to binary data that makes text visible as letters on punched tape.
Punched paper tapes were popular way to store computer data in 60's - 80's. Punched tape is 1" wide paper tape that has nine data "tracks" that's used for data storage and synchronisation. Data itself are represented as small punched holes in this tape. This program can be useful if You have functional paper tape punch and You want to make some kind of retro-computing themed texts out of tape. See pictures for examples.
Program is written on Python and is tested as fully working on Raspberry Pi. In my case, prepared data is output to serial port where's connected noname tape punch from weaving machine.

Usage is simple - You run program with text as argument. You'll get binary data as output. You can forward that data to file or directly to serial port where tape punch is connected.
